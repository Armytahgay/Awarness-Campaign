      <p>Homelessness is defined as “the state of having no home”. It’s a situation in which an individual or family lacks a stable, permanent residence such as those living in shelters or sleeping on the streets, in cars, in canyons, and underpasses, people staying temporarily in shelters or hotels, and “couch surfers”.</p>

        <p>One major cause is a lack of affordable housing. Certain people can’t afford a house due to their unemployment, physical or mental illness. Some others have a job but doesn’t make enough money to pay the housing. Coming back after living through war, having natural disasters, or a personal hardship, such as domestic abuse can also cause people to be homeless.</p>
        <p>It can be anyone, beginning with students leaving their home for the first time to person quitting prison, passing by pregnant women with nowhere to stay when the baby comes.</p></p>

        <h3>Who are we?</h3><p>We are a group of students who launched the association in the IUT of Lyon 1 in Villeurbanne in France.</p>
        <h3>Our goals</h3><p>Our association is doing long term and short term actions.
        Our first goals are to help Lyon’s homeless students and students in need . We are doing so by giving them food and clothes. Some students volonteer to give them shelter and/or a place to shower, clean their clothes. But most importantly we are helping them off the streets.
        Our second goals are to help homeless people in general. For now we are doing food & clothes distribution.
        To be able to distribute food & clothes we are doing event to gather food and clothes.</p>
        <h3>Future goals</h3><p>The future goals of the associations are to allow a small group of homeless students to sleep at the IUT and to work as maintenance staff for the IUT after their classes. But this will be a temporary solution to help them find a job and a home.
        We also hope to open our project to non students and encourage companies to join  us in this initiative.</p>
